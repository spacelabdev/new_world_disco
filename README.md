# new_world_disco
A working repo where we are iterating on working CNN's that discover exoplanets. This New World Discovery repository should be forked by anyone interested in playing with Convolutional Neural Networks and the lightkurve.org python library to learn about and find new exoplanets.

### Background
This work is built on the PyTorch code created by Dr. Megan Ansdell et al at <a href='https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/'>NASA's Frontier Development Lab</a> in 2018 <a href='https://gitlab.com/frontierdevelopmentlab/exoplanets/exonet-pytorch'>(link to gitlab code repo)</a>

Her work was an improvement upon the prior work of Dr. Andrew Vanderburg and Chris Shallue et all from 2016 <a href='https://github.com/cshallue/exoplanet-ml'>(link to github code repo)</a>

### Datasets
The dataset to start out with if you are using the exonet.py program can be found <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N6bA2rahvV5kcOGmJnTA5gl_Thno7hTh/view'>here</a>. You should download and unzip these files in a nearby directory for easy use.

You should use Lightkurve.org to pull new data for this project. As time goes on, there will be more tutorial-like resources availble to help you preprocess the data, but in general, see the papers from Ansdell et al and Vanderburg et al cited below as they walk you through how to prepare your data pipeline for model training and inference.
